# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
### Create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Results
### Rural areas had the least number of total rides, total drivers and fares. The suburban areas had the second lowest number of total rides, total drivers and total fares. The urban areas had the highest number of total rides, total drivers and total fares for PyBer. There seems to be a inverse relationship between the total number of rides and and average fare per driver. Lastly, there is a significant difference between the average fare per driver between the Urban and Rural areas. 

## Summary
### There seems to be a huge shortage of drivers in the rural areas. The ratio of total drivers to total rides in the rural areas are significantly less than the ratio of totoal drivers to total rides in the urban and suburban areas. As a result, the average fare per driver and the average fare per ride are more expensive. The only way to reduce the cost of the fare and improve access is to increase the total number of drivers in the rural areas.
